Let's get together along with the group of people already united around https://github.com/opensourcecities/montreal to
share some ideas and start interesting open source related discussions :)

We'll have 2 presentations to be announced soon (will update this description as soon as it's confirmed) but the most
important thing is to get there and finally meet this amazing group of people and help decide what direction do we want
to take with this meetup."
